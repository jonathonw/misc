A collection of assorted scripts and utilities I've found useful.

* **SongConverter** - Converts MediaShout text files to a format
  more conducive to use with ProPresenter.
* **PPMidiController** - Use a MIDI controller to control
  ProPresenter - adjust transition times, move back/forward 
  between slides, clear the screen.  Designed for the Korg
  NanoKontrol 2, but should work with any MIDI controller which
  can be configured to send control change messages on the
  correct channels.
